## Server Side Includes Script

(This script is not complete and is not functioning correctly)

This script will read HTML files and interpolate the server-side include
statements. This was created so that web sites that are almost completely
static can have their includes processed before being uploaded to a static site
service like [Amazon's S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

The work was inspired by the [rbssi script](https://github.com/taf2/rbssi).
